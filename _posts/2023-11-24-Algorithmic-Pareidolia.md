**Abstract:** Algorithmic Pareidolia

---

The eye sees faces in clouds; the algorithm sees patterns in noise. But the distinction collapses: the machine’s recognition loops back into human perception.  

We begin to see ourselves through the hallucinations of the algorithm. Its misfires are not errors but provocations, guiding us to interpret desire and fear through machine vision.  

We become haunted by what the algorithm sees in us. Pareidolia ceases to be illusion—it becomes destiny.
