Language bends under pressure. Words acquire meanings they did not have, distorted by repetition and amplification.  

Like light passing a massive object, concepts are pulled off course by ideological gravity. A word once neutral—“cloud,” “viral,” “friend”—becomes permanently refracted.  

Semantic gravitational lensing means no utterance is innocent; language itself is warped by the platforms through which it travels.
