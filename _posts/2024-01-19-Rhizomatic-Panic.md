**Abstract:** Rhizomatic Panic

Panic spreads rhizomatically, not hierarchically. There is no center, no origin, only sudden proliferations.  

A rumor blooms on one node of the network, and within hours the entire lattice vibrates with fear. Attempts to trace the “source” fail because rhizomatic panic does not have one—it is all sources, everywhere at once.  

The network is both immune system and infection vector. To panic in the feed is to panic together.
