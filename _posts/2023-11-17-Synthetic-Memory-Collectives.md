We no longer remember alone. Platforms produce collective memory by algorithmic fiat: what trends, what recirculates, what becomes a “moment.”  

These memories are synthetic—fabricated by curation, enforced by repetition, shared by default. What was once communal storytelling has become datafied recollection. You remember what others remembered, not what happened.  

In time, individual memory feels counterfeit next to the viral archive. Entire populations dream the same dream, imposed from above. Collective memory has always been constructed; now it is programmed.
