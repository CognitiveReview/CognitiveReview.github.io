Deleted files, broken links, abandoned profiles: the internet leaves behind its own archaeology. These are data fossilsâ€”remnants of prior epochs of communication, already unreadable, already strange.  

Every click produces sediment, but only some layers survive platform collapse and obsolescence. Future historians will dig not into earth but into server dumps, reconstructing civilizations from corrupted archives.  

The fossil record of data is patchy, arbitrary, and already eroding. Memory itself is stratified, with entire eras inaccessible.
