**Abstract:** Uncanny Valley Consensus

---

When consensus itself feels artificial, we enter the uncanny valley of opinion. It is not that views are imposed but that agreement arrives too quickly, too frictionlessly, as though orchestrated.  

Consensus now functions as simulation: an affect of shared belief generated by bots, algorithms, influencers. We sense it isn’t real, yet still participate.  

Like synthetic faces that almost look human, consensus almost feels collective. The valley lies in that gap—when agreement feels alien.
