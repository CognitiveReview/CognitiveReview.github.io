**Abstract:** Pre-Linguistic Pulse

Before words, there were rhythmsâ€”heartbeat, breath, hunger. The feed taps into this pre-linguistic pulse, bypassing language entirely. Scrolling is a metronome, aligning human nervous systems to machinic tempo.  

The addictiveness of content derives not from narrative but from rhythm: the endless repetition of swipe, refresh, repeat. Platforms have learned to speak not to our words but to our pulses.  

In this way, content becomes somatic. The body, not the mind, is what the algorithm addicts.
