**Abstract:** Anomalous Consensus

Sometimes agreement itself becomes suspicious. Too rapid, too total, too clean. It is not the absence of dissent but the eerie smoothness of unanimity that unsettles.  

Anomalous consensus is manufactured alignment, an enforced harmony that reveals itself by its implausibility. It is the silence of disagreement erased, the simulation of collective will.  

What frightens us is not conflict but the absence of itâ€”the sense that consensus has been coded in advance.
