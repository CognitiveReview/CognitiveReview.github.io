**Abstract:** Ghost Protocols

Protocols are instructions for how to connect, how to communicate. But every connection leaves behind spectersâ€”abandoned addresses, obsolete standards, ghost traffic still echoing in the system.  

Ghost protocols are rules that no longer govern yet continue to shape the structure of networks. Like ruins, they persist invisibly, encoding absence as architecture.  

To log on is to commune with ghosts: every packet routes through the remnants of forgotten systems.
