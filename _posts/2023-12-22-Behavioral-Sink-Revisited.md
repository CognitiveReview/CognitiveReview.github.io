**Abstract:** Behavioral Sink Revisited

In the 1960s, ethologist John Calhoun described the “behavioral sink” of overcrowded rats collapsing into madness. Today, the internet is the global behavioral sink.  

Overpopulation is not physical but cognitive—too many signals, too many voices, too much data. Like Calhoun’s rats, we turn inward, fragment, fixate on compulsions.  

Depression, anxiety, compulsive scrolling: symptoms of a habitat saturated beyond livability. The digital city is overcrowded even when you are alone.
