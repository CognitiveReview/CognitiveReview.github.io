**Abstract:** Predictive Validity: Digital Drag

The future has been pre-decidedâ€”not by prophecy but by recommendation. Predictive analytics function as self-fulfilling prophecies.  

You are shown what you are statistically likely to want, and in choosing it, you confirm the prediction. This is digital drag: the sensation of being pulled forward by the gravitational weight of probability.  

Free will collapses into a tautology. The system does not predict what you will do; it ensures you will do what it predicts.
