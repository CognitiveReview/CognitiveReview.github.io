**Abstract:** Linguistic Pareidolia

---

Not only images but words carry pareidolia. We glimpse meaning in fragments of text, mishear phrases, hallucinate intention in noise.  

Online, this becomes systemic. Autocomplete, predictive text, and AI-generated prose collapse the boundary between sense and nonsense. Readers stitch together coherence from algorithmic scraps.  

Meaning is less discovered than imposed. We are trapped in a hall of linguistic echoes, where sense itself has become automated hallucination.
