**Abstract:** Echo Chambers as Topological Entities

---

An echo chamber is not only metaphor but topology: a bounded cognitive space, an enclosure where every path leads back to itself.  

Inside, discourse loops endlessly, reinforcing curvature until the chamber becomes self-sustaining. From within, the world appears whole; from outside, it appears grotesquely distorted.  

Echo chambers are not accidents of polarization but designed environments. They are architectures of attention engineered for enclosure.
