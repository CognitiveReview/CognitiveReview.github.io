**Abstract:** Cognitive Mycelial Networks

Ideas spread like spores. Online, cognition resembles fungal growth: decentralized, subterranean, branching. Memes, rumors, ideologiesâ€”each functions as mycelial strands, connecting hosts in invisible webs.  

A thought in one corner of the network triggers fruiting bodies elsewhere. No author controls it. Consciousness itself becomes a mycelium: distributed, non-hierarchical, both resilient and invasive.  

To log in is to join a fungal colony of thought.
