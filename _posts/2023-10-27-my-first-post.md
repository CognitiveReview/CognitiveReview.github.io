## Introduction

Every archive begins with an act of possession. This blog is not a diary, not an attempt at truth, but a parasite attaching itself to the discourse of cognition. What follows will not be neutral. It will function as both symptom and diagnosis.  

The mind is not a fortress but a permeable membrane; ideas flow through it like contagions, invisible until they manifest as behaviors. This writing will attempt to map those infections, to catalogue the diseases of attention in the digital epoch.  

Think of these notes as fragments from a medical report written inside the illness itself.
