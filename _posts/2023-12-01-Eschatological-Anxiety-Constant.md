The end of the world used to be a mythic event. Now it is a daily notification. Climate collapse, geopolitical breakdown, AI singularityâ€”the feed collapses them into a single, permanent background hum.  

Eschatological anxiety is no longer episodic but constant, a baseline affect of online life. Platforms weaponize this dread: you refresh not to be comforted but to confirm that disaster still looms.  

The apocalypse has already happened, endlessly deferred, perpetually monetized.
