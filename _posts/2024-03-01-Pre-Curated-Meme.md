**Abstract:** Pre-Curated Meme

---

Memes arrive already curated, already optimized for virality. Platforms anticipate their form before they exist, seeding formats, testing prototypes.  

The meme is no longer folk culture but pre-manufactured folklore, a product designed to feel spontaneous. What spreads is not random but preselected.  

The pre-curated meme embodies the collapse of culture into experiment: an entertainment laboratory where participation is predicted, not chosen.
