**Abstract:** Review: The Digital Subconscious Manuscript

---

A manuscript circulates—its author anonymous, its origin uncertain. It describes the existence of a “digital subconscious”: the layer of behavior below conscious choice, where clicks and scrolls sediment into habit.  

Unlike Freud’s unconscious, this one is not private. It is continuously scraped, quantified, optimized. The manuscript insists: what dreams are to psychoanalysis, browsing histories are to data science.  

If true, then our unconscious no longer belongs to us. It has been externalized, captured in databases, and subjected to experimental manipulation. The digital subconscious is not hidden—it is for sale.
