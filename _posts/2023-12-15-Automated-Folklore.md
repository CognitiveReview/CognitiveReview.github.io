Memes are the fairy tales of the digital unconscious. Their authorship is collective, their circulation automatic. They encode lessons—often cruel, often absurd—not in moral terms but in affective force.  

The folklore of the feed is automated because no one controls it; the platform itself is the bard, endlessly remixing archetypes.  

We live inside a mythos that updates hourly. To know the culture is to scroll.
