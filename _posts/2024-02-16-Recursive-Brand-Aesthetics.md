**Abstract:** Recursive Brand Aesthetics

---

Brands no longer reference products; they reference themselves. Logos mutate, colors shift, slogans are inverted, remixed, memed. The recursion is the aesthetic.  

A brand now thrives on its own distortion, its ability to circulate in mutated forms. Authenticity dissolves into endless feedback loops of image and parody.  

Recursive brand aesthetics are not accidents of culture but deliberate strategies: corporations designing for their own memetic corruption.
