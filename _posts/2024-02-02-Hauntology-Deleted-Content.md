**Abstract:** Hauntology: Deleted Content

---

What is deleted does not disappear. It haunts. The gap in the feed is itself a message: something was there, something is missing.  

Deleted content lingers as screenshots, rumors, memory. Its absence structures discourse as much as presence. The platform thrives on this ghost economy, where what cannot be retrieved becomes infinitely desirable.  

To delete is to summon. Every erasure produces its own specter.
